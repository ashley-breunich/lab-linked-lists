![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Linked List Data Structure
================================================================

## Submission Instructions
* Follow the data structures submission instructions

### Before you begin
* You'll need to initialize the implementation folder as a new node module, install your dependencies, setup your npm script commands, and pull in your config files


## Requirements
* implement a Singly Linked List (SLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

* implement a Doubly Linked List (DLL) data structure
* implement `append(value)`, `prepend(value)`, `reverse()`, and `remove(offset)` methods to the SLL class
* implement `serialize()` and `deserialize()` methods on the class
* in a comment within each function, note the it's Big-O runtime

#### Testing
  * write at least three test assertions for each method of the Linked List Data Structure
  * organize your tests into appropriate describe/it blocks for test output readability

####  Documentation
In order to use this program and get it running on your own computer, you will need to go to the [GitHub link](hhttps://github.com/ashley-breunich/lab-linked-lists), fork the repository, and then clone it down to your machine.

After that, you will want to make sure you install eslint and lint. You can do that by typing 'npm i eslint' and 'npm i lint' into the command line.

You can run the tests by installing JEST. You can do so by typing 'npm i jest' in your command line after you have run npm init and set up your package.json. Once you have that set up run 'jest --watchAll' in your command line to run the tests. This will allow you to see what tests are passing/failing every time you make a save.

##### Append(Value)

##### Prepend(Value)
  * in your README, write documentation for you data structures
  * your documentation should includes code block useage examples
  * provide instructions for:
    * installing and using your data structure
    * accessing each method
    * running your tests
